# osrs-recolor-gui
Turning the recolorFrom and recolorTo values from the cache to useful rgb value

## Launching the GUI with a double-click

You no longer need to open a terminal each time you want to use the tool. Pick the launcher that matches your operating system and double-click it from your file explorer.

### Windows

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed and available through either the **Python Launcher** (`py`) or the regular `python` command.
2. Double-click `run_osrs_recolor_gui.bat`.
   * The script automatically changes into the project directory before launching `osrs_recolor_gui.py`.
   * If Python is not found you will see an error window—install Python and try again.

### macOS

1. Run `chmod +x run_osrs_recolor_gui.command` once (right-click → “Open With Terminal” also works the first time).
2. Double-click `run_osrs_recolor_gui.command` to start the GUI in a new Terminal window.

### Linux

1. Run `chmod +x run_osrs_recolor_gui.sh` to make the launcher executable.
2. Double-click `run_osrs_recolor_gui.sh` (choose **Run** if prompted) or create a desktop shortcut that executes the script.
